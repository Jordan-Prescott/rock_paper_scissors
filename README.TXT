########### ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS #############

Me and my colleagues are always settling things in the office with this game.
Such as who drives to the shop at dinner time (UK meaning for lunch) or who wil do something 
the others do not want to do. With this in mind I thought I would build the game using python. 


If you have not played this game before (do you live under a ROCK?) this is how the game works. 
Each option ROCK, PAPER, or SCISSORS loses to one option and wins against another. Moving clockwise on
the below diagram you can see which option beats which.

For example you choose ROCK, moving clockwise you beat SCISSORS but if you apponent (in this case the Computer)
chooses PAPER you lose.
